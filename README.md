# Rubarb Demo App
This is a simple app used to demonstrate the [Rubarb](https://github.com/jamesball27/rubarb) MVC framework.

To run the app, clone this repo locally, navigate to the root directory, and run `$ bundle exec ruby server.rb` in your terminal. Then navigate to `localhost:3000` in your browser to see the app in action!
